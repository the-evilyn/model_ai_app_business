rag_engine.py
─────────────
Simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) engine for the NexusAI chatbot.

First version:
  • Loads documents from ``data/knowledge_documents.json``.
  • Falls back to embedded sample documents when the file is absent.
  • Splits documents into chunks.
  • Uses TF-IDF (scikit-learn) for retrieval, with a keyword fallback.
  • Returns the top-k most relevant chunks.

Architecture notes for future upgrades:
  • The ``retrieve_context`` function is the public interface.  Replace its
    internals with MongoDB Atlas Vector Search when ready — callers won't
    change.
  • ``embeddingVector`` is stored as ``null`` for now; populate it later
    with a real embedding model.

# 3. Replace ``retrieve_context`` internals:
#
#     from pymongo import MongoClient
